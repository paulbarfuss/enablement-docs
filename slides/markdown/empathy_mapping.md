## Empathy Mapping



### Empathy Mapping
#### _What Is It?_
* A tool to capture and visualize what key stakeholders are sensing when in a
particular context or completing a set of tasks
* A way to form a better understanding of users and build personas
* Information is captured directly from interviews, observations, and other
facilitated conversation exercises
* Senses captured can include what the person is seeing, thinking, doing, and feeling
* Originated from Dave Gray of [XPLANE](http://www.xplane.com/)

### Empathy Mapping
#### _Why Use It?_
* Captures information and learning directly from the end user affected by the
system/application/solution in question
* Enables a direct connection between important stakeholders and developers, e.g.
developers of an application can learn directly from end users using it
* The tool identifies pain points, opportunities, and starts to form a basis for
improvement and optimization
* The tool can be used to move from user empathy to value propositions



## Empathy Mapping Demonstration
